        <p>Quasians (Quasi Hominitos) are the most powerful, yet scarce species of artifical bipedal, characterised by their overall pale appearence and power. These enable the use of telepathy and allow the manipulation of matter. Quasians are
          primarily introverted and tend to live in small, isolated groups comprised of multiple alien races. Social interactions between Quasians are based on mutual respect and interest which bolster the Quasians naturally curious nature to explore
          and understand both the universe and other living beings.<br><br>Though closely related, many scientists consider the Quasians to be a completely separate species to Humans despite sharing so many features, however, traces of Human DNA can
          be found in the previous Quasian generation. Anatomically accurate Quasians were created and improved on by the <a class="link" href="#">Quasar Union</a> in 18QR. For the most of their history, Quasians have been relatively antisocial
          observers, watching other races develop up until the <a class="link" href="#">Golden Age</a>. As a result of Humans abducting Quasians, they became much more open and began to go rogue and attack Human Starships, which got worse after the
          rise of the <a class="link" href="#">Nequasian Empire</a>
          decades later. <a class="link" href="#">The Rebel War</a> which resulted in the downfall of the <a class="link" href="#">Xurixan Empire</a> saw the emergence of a newfound attitude in Quasians, making them more careless and not as
          introverted. The Quasian population quickly became larger and denser, however it's still rare to find more than 15 Quasians on any planet with the exception of the capital. Since the <a class="link" href="#">Great Quasian Slaughter</a>, the
          population has been steadily increasing and currently stands at around 78,000.<br><br>The artificial origin of the Quasians has resulted in very little genetic variation, however, there are genes which only activate in certain Quasians
          giving them a slightly different appearance. Every Quasians is exactly 99.97% identical. Like Humans, Quasians are sexually dimorphic: Generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. Females are
          capable of Pregnancy and unlike Humans, never become infertile.</p>
