        <p>Quasians (Quasi Hominitos) are the most powerful, yet scarce species of artifical bipedal, characterised by their overall pale appearence and brain complexity allowing the use of telepathy, manipulation of matter and calculation of
          extremely complex math. Quasians are primarily introverted and tend to live in small, isolated groups comprised of multiple alien races. Social interactions between Quasians are based on mutual respect and interest which bolster the
          Quasians naturally curious nature to explore and understand both the universe and other living beings.<br><br>Though closely related, many scientists consider the Quasians to be a completely separate species to <a class="link"
            href="#">Humans</a> despite sharing so many features, however, traces of Human DNA can be found in the Quasian genome. Anatomically accurate Quasians were created and improved on by the <a class="link" href="#">Quasar Union</a> in 5QR
          (2092). For the rest of history, Quasians have been relatively antisocial observers, watching other races develop up until the <a class="link" href="#">Golden Age</a>, where they became more open and aggressive as a result of Quasian
          abductions. This got worse after the <a class="link" href="#">Great Quasian Slaughter</a> by the <a class="link" href="#">Xurixan Empire</a> decades later which saw the mass slaughter of Quasians in an attempt to trigger a mass extinction
          event which almost worked, expecially after the destruction of the ark and consequently, the required facilities for healthy Quasian Reproduction. As of 0Na (2220), there are approximately 3,789 Quasian individuals left.<br><br>Unlike
          Humans, Quasians have no biological variation, however, Quasians can have extreme personality differences. All Quasians are exactly 99.9% similar, varying only slightly in a few physical features. Quasians are sexually dimorphic: generally,
          males have greater body strength and power, whereas females have a higher body fat percentage and improved self healing potential. At puberty, Quasians develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, and never
          become infertile.</p>
