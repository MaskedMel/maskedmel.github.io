        <p>Quasians (<i>Quasi provectus</i>) are the most powerful, yet scarce species of artifical bipedal, characterised by their overall pale appearence and brain complexity allowing the use of telepathy, manipulation of matter and calculation of
          extremely complex math. Quasians are primarily introverted and tend to live in small, isolated groups comprised of multiple alien races. Social interactions between Quasians are based on mutual respect and interest which bolster the
          Quasians naturally curious nature to explore and understand both the universe and other living beings.<br><br>Though closely related, many scientists consider the Quasians to be a completely separate species to <a class="link"
            href="#">Humans</a> despite sharing so many features, however, traces of Human DNA can be found in the Quasian genome. Anatomically accurate Quasians were created and improved on by the <a class="link" href="#">Quasar Union</a> in 5QR
          (2092). For the rest of history, Quasians have been relatively antisocial observers, watching other races develop up until the <a class="link" href="#">Golden Age</a>, where they became more open and aggressive as a result of Quasian
          abductions. This got worse after the <a class="link" href="#">Great Quasian Slaughter</a> by the <a class="link" href="#">Xurixan Empire</a> decades later which saw the mass slaughter of Quasians in an attempt to trigger a mass extinction
          event which almost worked, especially after the destruction of the ark and consequently, the required facilities for healthy Quasian Reproduction. As of 0Na (2220), there are approximately 3,789 Quasian individuals left.<br><br>Unlike
          Humans, Quasians have no biological variation, however, Quasians can have extreme personality differences. All Quasians are exactly 99.9% similar, varying only slightly in a few physical features. Quasians are sexually dimorphic: generally,
          males have greater body strength and power, whereas females have a higher body fat percentage and improved self healing potential. At puberty, Quasians develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, and never
          become infertile.<br><br>Quasians are omnivores, capable of consuming a wide varietyof plant and animal material, however primarily use synthetic food processors to create food. They can survive for up to 16 weeks without food, and two or
          three days without water. Quasians are generally nocturnal, sleeping on average four to six hours a day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and father provide care for their children
          during young adult years, as children have to be incubated for six to ten years.<br><br>Similar to humans, Quasians have a large, highly developed prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. They are
          highly intelligent, capable of advanced episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness and a theory of mind. The Quasian mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition and forming views on
          existence. Advanced technological success has led to strategic resource distribution and a reputation of being protectors for other alien races.</p>

      <h2 class="new-section">Etymology and definition</h2>
      <hr class="hr-wikipage">
      <div class="wikipagecontent">
        <p>All modern Quasians are classified into the species <i>Quasi provectus</i>, coined by <a class="link" href="#">G-22</a>. Quasian naming conventions are different to that of humans, but put simply, the generic name <a class="link"
            href="#">Quasi</a> declares a species as being <a class="link" href="#">Quasian Engineered.</a> Quasian refers to all members of the Quasi provectus species. Provectus is a latin word chosen by human exobiologists, meaning "advanced." A
          Human word was decided upon to represent the human genetics present in the Quasian genome. The name "Quasi provectus" means Advanced Quasian Engineering</p>

      <h2 class="new-section">Origins</h2>
      <hr class="hr-wikipage">
      <div class="wikipagecontent">
        <p>Quasians are an engineered species, based on humans and designed to be the perfect species. The first Quasians still retained roughly 50% of the human genome, but eventually after continued experimentation, Quasians lost all of it, only
          retaining traces. <br><br> Occasionally, a Quasian will be born with a small amount of human DNA. This is considered genetic defect and is corrected as soon as possible during a Quasians incubation stage.</p>

      <h2 class="new-section">History</h2>
      <hr class="hr-wikipage">
      <div class="wikipagecontent">
        <p>Until about 0Ga (2100), most Quasians lived as antisocial observers and were shrouded in mystery. The Golden Age saw the Quasians change into a more known, and respected species which led to better integration into other alien societies.
          around 27Ga, Quasians became well known as mercenaries, scientists, explorers and traders. During this time, Quasian culture and biology became common knowledge. <br><br> 2200Ga is when the Quasian Government, The Quasar Coalition fell
          during a conflict with the <a class="link" href="#">Xurixan Empire</a>. Eventually, both the Milky Way and Andromeda was dominated by the <a class="link" href="#">Xurixan Empire</a>. A Rebellion founded by the <a class="link"
            href="#">Nyx</a> saw the end of the war and the newfound independence which separated the Quasian species from the Quasar Coalition, brining in a new diverse lifestyle for most Quasians.

      <h2 class="new-section">Habitat and population</h2>
      <hr class="hr-wikipage">
      <div class="wikipagecontent">
        <p>The first Quasians were dependant on the <a class="link" href="#">Ark (mk.I)</a>, a large megastation with a radius of approximately 3,000km. Modern Quasians, however, are largely able to live wherever they want. Since the destruction of
          the <a class="link" href="#">Ark mk.I</a>, Quasians began to live in small communities mixed with aliens. The Quasians outstanding biological resistance to most adverse conditions means they can live wherever they want for as long as they
          want. Most locations are chosen based on technological, religious and cultural significance to other alien species.<br><br>Quasians are one of the most naturally adaptable species and have a high tolerance for all conditions. Quasians are
          still extremely hard to find in large gatherings or groups. At most, only three to five Quasians will live in the same location at the same time.</p>
